These are the global rules of the Oya protocol.

1. **Supported Tokens and Actions:**  
   - Only ERC20 and ERC721 tokens are supported. Tokens deposited by mistake that are unsupported may be withdrawn by the original depositor.
   - The supported token actions on the Oya blockchain are deposit, withdraw, and transfer.

2. **Vault Initialization and Block Production:**  
   - After a vault is created, a signed intention from the vault’s controller address—if included in a block by any block proposer—may set additional parameters for the vault.
   - The first block proposer to submit a signed message from the controller address for a vault will be designated as that vault’s initial block producer.

3. **Block Proposer Assignment:**  
   - Each vault may have only one block proposer at a time.
   - A block proposer can be changed either via a signed intention included in a block or by a transaction directly from the vault’s controller address.
   - Any change in block proposers is subject to a delay of 30 minutes, as recorded in the event logs.

4. **Vault Balances and Transfers:**  
   - Vault balances can increase via deposits or transfers, and decrease via withdrawals or transfers.
   - A transfer recorded on the Oya blockchain is verified by the optimistic oracle. This process does not require an actual movement of tokens within the VaultTracker contract or any on-chain state change on the host blockchain.
   - To execute a withdrawal or transfer of tokens in a vault, the vault must have a sufficient balance of that token.

5. **Block Finality and Disputes:**  
   - Proposed state changes in a block are considered valid unless a dispute is raised during the optimistic oracle’s challenge period.
   - If a block is disputed, it is discarded, and any valid state changes MUST be re-proposed in the next block from that block's producer.
   - In the case where new blocks were built on top of a disputed block, all subsequent blocks should also be disputed and discarded, and any valid state changes contained in those subsequent blocks must be re-proposed in the next block from that block's producer.
   - A replacement block must include all valid state changes from the disputed block; omission of any valid state changes will render the replacement block invalid and disputable.
   - The data for a block must be publicly available, and a quorum of 1/10 of active staked verifiers must attest to the data's availability during the first thirty minutes of the challenge period.
   - A block must include a list of all historical blocks that are relevant to the new block's state changes, and the data for each of these blocks must be publicly available, with a quorum of 1/10 of active staked verifiers attesting to the data's availability during the first thirty minutes of the challenge period.

6. **Nonce Management:**  
   - Every signed intention for a vault must have an incrementing nonces (0, 1, 2, …, n), with each new intention’s nonce exactly one unit higher than the previous.
   - Each block produced by a particular block proposer must also have incrementing nonces, with the replacement block using the same nonce as any disputed block.

7. **Amendments to Global Rules:**  
   - Changes to the global rules require Oya tokenholder approval, and may only come into effect after a minimum time delay of seven days.
   - New features for the Oya blockchain may be implemented through amendments to the global rules.
   - If the Oya tokenholder governance process has been compromised due to a bug, exploit, or other technical failure, changes to the global rules shall be considered invalid, and the rules existing prior to the issue shall remain in effect.

8. **Compliance with Vault-Specific Rules:**  
   - Every signed intention for a vault must adhere to that vault’s individual rules; otherwise, the intention shall be considered invalid, and any block containing the invalid intention shall be invalid.
