These are example rules for an individual vault.

1. **Token and Chain Support:**  
   - This vault accepts transfers of all tokens on all chains supported by the Oya protocol.

2. **Controller Key Inactivity:**  
   - If the controller key produces no signed intentions for a period of six months, the keys to the controller address shall be considered lost and unrecoverable.
   - In such a case, the designated guardian may propose a change of the controller to a new address.

3. **Guardian Removal:**  
   - A guardian may be removed by a signed intention from the controller address, but only after a mandatory 14-day waiting period.
   - If, during that period, the controller address signs an intention to retain the guardian, the removal shall be canceled.

4. **Daily Transfer Limits:**  
   - The vault shall not transfer more than $10,000 in token value within any given 24-hour period.

5. **Vault Rule Amendments:**  
   - Changes to the vaultâ€™s rules must be signed by both the controller address and the guardian address.
   - Any proposed change shall not be finalized until at least seven days have passed since the intention was proposed.
   - If either the controller or the guardian signs an intention to cancel the change during this period, the proposed amendment shall be canceled.

6. **Key Compromise Protocol:**  
   - If the controller address signs an intention indicating that its key has been compromised, the vault should be placed in a frozen state by the vault guardian.
   - Following such an event, the controller address may be changed by an intention signed by both the controller and the guardian.
